<h2 align="left"> Abstract </h2>

<p align="justify">
Code smells are bad code structures that can harm quality and maintainability. To remove these bad structures, developers use refactoring techniques. Refactoring helps code be easier to understand and modify by eliminating potential problems and improving internal quality attributes such as cohesion, coupling, complexity, inheritance, and size. Most refactoring activities are usually performed manually and undisciplined, which can cause code degradation. Currently, concepts, practices, software refactoring tools, and code smells are little discussed in undergraduate computing courses. This problem is reflected in the software industry, which generally does not use refactoring practices to improve code readability and maintainability. In this context, we present in this paper an experience report on teaching the practice of code smells refactoring and the impact on internal quality attributes. The study was carried out in two undergraduate classes in a Software Quality course, investigating the following topics: (i) code smells more difficult to refactor, (ii) the most commonly used refactoring techniques to refactor code smells, (iii) the impact of code smells refactoring on internal quality attributes, (iv) the studentsâ€™ perception of code smells refactoring practices, and (v) difficulties encountered in code smells refactoring. Our findings contribute to replicating the practice in other courses that want to delve into code smell refactoring and contribute to the use of refactoring practices and code quality evaluation.
