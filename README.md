<h1 align="left"> Teaching Code Smells Refactoring to Software Engineering
Students: What is the Impact of Removing these Smells on
Internal Quality Attributes? </h1>

<h2 align="left"> Abstract </h2>

<p align="justify">
Code smells are bad code structures that can harm quality and
maintainability. To remove these bad structures, developers use
refactoring techniques. Refactoring helps code be easier to under-
stand and modify by eliminating potential problems and improving
internal quality attributes such as cohesion, coupling, complexity,
inheritance and size. Most of the refactoring activities are usually
performed manually and undisciplined, which can cause code degra-
dation. Currently, concepts, practices and tools of refactoring and
code smells are little discussed in the disciplines of undergraduate
computing courses. This problem is reflected in the software indus-
try, which generally does not use refactoring practices to improve
code readability and maintainability. In this context, we present in
this paper an experience report on teaching the practice of code
smells refactoring and the impact on internal quality attributes. The
study was carried out in two undergraduate classes in the course
of software quality, investigating the following topics: (i) skills ac-
quired in the practice of code smells refactoring, (ii) difficulties
encountered in code smells refactoring, (iii) code smells more diffi-
cult to refactor, (iv) most commonly used refactoring techniques to
refactor code smells, (v) impact of code smells refactoring on inter-
nal quality attributes, and (vi) studentsâ€™ perception of code smells
refactoring practices. Our findings contribute to the replication of
the practice in other courses that want to delve into code smell
refactoring and contribute to the use of refactoring practices and
code quality evaluation in the industry.
